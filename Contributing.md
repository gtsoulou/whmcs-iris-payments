## Coding Standards

### PHP Coding Style

Follow these guidelines when writing PHP code:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Functions: `camelCase` or `snake_case` (match WHMCS style)
   - Variables: `$camelCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

3. **Comments**:
   ```php
   /**
    * Function description
    *
    * @param array $params Description
    * @return string Description
    */
   ```

4. **Security**:
   - Always sanitize user input: `htmlspecialchars()`, `htmlentities()`
   - Validate configuration parameters
   - Escape output properly

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Check for empty/null values
   - Provide fallback displays
   - Log errors appropriately

### HTML/CSS Style

- Use semantic HTML
- Keep inline styles minimal (module limitation)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test cross-browser compatibility

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide examples where helpful
- Keep formatting consistent
- Update relevant documentation files

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject
